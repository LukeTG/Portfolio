        <p class="about" id="about">
            I am from Carolina Beach, where I grew up with my mom and dad. When I graduate I want to be a composer or software designer of some kind. 
            I am taking SparkLab at Heide Trask Senior High School where I am also enrolled in Marching/Symphonic Band. 
            I play trumpet, piano, guitar, ukulele, and am the vocalist for a small band with some friends. 
            I currently work at Little Caesars, a chain fast food pizza restaurant.
